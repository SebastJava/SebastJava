### Self-Appointed Benevolent Designer

I did some electronic publishing and graphic design from 1988 to 2002. I was into early Apple Macintosh computers.

In my childhood in the 70s and 80s, I was passionate about computer programming and electronics.

**Today, I combine a bit of these two passions: design and technology.**

I do graphic design by diving straight into coding CSS, SASS, BASH, HTML, etc.

I am powered by the [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) system since 2017.
