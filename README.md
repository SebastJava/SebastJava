### Self-Appointed Benevolent Designer

I did some electronic publishing and graphic design towards the end of the twentieth century. I was into early Macintosh computers.

In my childhood in the 70s and 80s, I was passionate about computer programming and electronics.

Today, I combine a bit of the two: I do graphic design by diving straight into coding CSS, HTML, BASH, etc.

I've been a fan of Linux Mint since 2017.
