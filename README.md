### Self-Appointed Benevolent Designer

I've been using LinuxMint since 2017. I love this OS, but always felt there was room for improvement on the design side. Design isn't just about being pretty. Design is visual communication that works well and looks great. It seems to me that if LinuxMint started giving more importance to design, then the community would grow, there would be more people and more money, and everything would work better.

I've always been interested in electronics and science. In my youth, I did some programming on early personal computers. Later I had left all that to focus on computer graphics and print design. I have a few years of experience in design and printing. Today, being determined to improve the presentation of LinuxMint, I am slowly learning modern computer programming. Again.
