### Self-Appointed Benevolent Designer

I did some electronic publishing and graphic design from 1988 to 2002. I was into early Apple Macintosh computers.

During my childhood in the 70s and 80s, I was passionate about computer programming and electronics.

**Today, I combine a bit of these two passions: design and technology.**

I am on Linux since year 2017. I started on Linux Mint. I am now on Ubuntu since June 2024.
